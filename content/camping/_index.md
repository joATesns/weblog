I simply like doing this. What could be wrong with hanging around, relax mode on, having a bear and some almost-well-done comfort food ? There might a number of indirect reasons for this, but these are merely weak pointers at best.

* it's a 100% "Come as you are"-thing
* my mother used to camp a lot. If I remember correctly, all her childhood holiday's were camping trips.
* maybe it secretly makes me believe I'm in Faer&ucirc;n
* my preference of camping tuxedo's over regular ones

Father's Day 2018, I've gotten a tent from my family.

I needs no further argumentation that you want to **play** with your toys. So the first camping trips came quickly.

Father's Day 2019, I've gotten an additional module.

Needless to say ... this needs to be tested.
