## How I got into this
I like doing this. There might a number of indirect reasons for this, but these are merely weak pointers at best.

* my mother used to camp a lot. If I remember correctly, all her childhood holiday's were camping trips.
* maybe it secretly make me believe I'm in Faer&ucirc;n
* it's a 100% "Come as you are"-thing
* my preference of camping tuxedo's over regular ones

Father's Day 2018, I've gotten a tent from my family.
