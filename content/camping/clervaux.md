Traditions are to be kept alive (freely translated after a Dutch saying) !! So, we went on a camping trip with my brothers and his girlfriend. Deciding on the location is not an easy job, 3 days prior to departure. We've to take a dog, kids, the weather, distance and availability into account. After a quick search, we've decided to go to Clervaux, Luxemburg. The camping was originaly named: [Camping Clervaux](https://www.camping-clervaux.lu/). A small and nice camping next to the Clerve stream.
