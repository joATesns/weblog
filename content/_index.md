# A personal ABC² weblog

#### Welcome !


## This a hobby blog

As the title states: this is a hobby blog. Four activities I'm tracking at the moment are: astronomy, brewing, camping and coding. Hence the name ABCC = ABC²

More info and blog entries can be found by navigating there. Or was that too far fetched ? Move your mouse over your desk, your finger over your trackpad, or ... your finger to the screen (hell, it's >2018) ... and click, press, touch, ... 


## About me ... the weblogger-ist-er

I'm a going-to-40 years old male living in always-sunny Belgium. When I was looking for a selfie to post, as is done typically on this type of website, I had to realise that my most recent selfie is already more than a year old. I'm not really into all these social media and I wouldn't be amazed if I'd be called a bit paranoia when it comes to privacy.

Given that last statement, I can almost hear you think: **"Oy<sup>1</sup>, what about this site then ?"**. The answer to that hypothetical question would simply be: **convenient journal** (or weblog or, if I really must, *blog* ) **is convenient**<sup>2</sup>.


<sup>1</sup> Yes, I'm a big fan of [The Streets](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4GvOygVQquMaPm8oAc0vXi)

<sup>2</sup> Yes, I'm lazy. Use the right tool for the right job and your live gets so much easier.
