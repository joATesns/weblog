## About me

I think a lot can be said from the fact that my most recent selfie is already more than half a year old.

I'm not really into all these social media and I wouldn't be amazed if I'd be called a bit paranoia when it comes to privacy.

## This a hobby/personal blog

Three activities I'm tracking at the moment are: camping, brewing, and astronomy.

More info and blog entries can be found by navigating there. Or was that too far fetched ? Move your mouse over your desk, your finger over your trackpad, or ... your finger to the screen (hell, it's >2018) ... and click, press, touch, ...
