# Let's start with a starter

## Saturday, April 4th 2020
This is written during the Corona crisis. Probably I should add a wikipedia link later (as if that's going to happen). Because we have to stay home **#blijfinuwkot** I thought it was a good idea to make a sourdough starter.

With some browsing on the Internet and my personal advisor I got started.

After a call with my personal coach he pointed out that "00" (doppio zero) flour might not be ideal. As it's an experiment, I decided to try it anyway (as I had no other flower). 

The starter is made with 50 grams of water and 50 grams of flour.

I keep on feeding the starter every day. Half of the content I throw away, as in 50 grams. Next, 25 grams of water and 25 grams of flour are added again. Stirring and putting it away. After 1 week of nurturing the result is showing signs of life.

Also, I switched flour. As it's still the Corona lock-down, going to specialised shops is a bit difficult. General stores only have <s>bleached</s><sup>1</sup> flour. The other types are all sold out. Apparently everyone is baking. So I switched to "pattiserie" flour. Actually, I guess that's the same as the doppio zero, but **shrug**.

<sup>1</sup> My coach corrected me: bleached flour is forbidden in Europe. What I (probably) meant was T450 or extremely sifted flour.

After another week of feeding I think it's really started. The picture below is taken 2 hours after feeding :-)
