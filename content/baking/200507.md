# Another Corona weekend coming up

As the family is still in/around the house, I'll not start brewing. Let's bake another bread. Last week, we bought bread from a general grocery shop. I must say, ... there **is** a difference !!

## Day -1, 15h15 - Waking up the starter

I've binned half of the starter and re-fed it with 50/50 water/flour.

## Day 0, 06h45 - Preferment

As the Corona crisis is still in full force, (general) flour isn't easy to get your hands on. Grocery stores are through their supply, so it's on to the specialised shops. Alas, last weekend, when I finally got around doing that, I noticed upon parking the car that I forgot my wallet. so ... whatever I have, will have to make do.

* 10 grams of rye flour
* 55 grams of standard white flour
* 55 grams of wheat flour (T110²)
* 120 grams of water
* 24 grams of starter

² whatever this means ... I'll have to find out.

## Day 0, 18h45 - Preferment

I've let the preferment sit for 12 hours, without a lid :(
