# Towards a daily bread recipe
So, despite all the mistakes, the bread ended up quite nice and tasty. Even my daughter likes it, how great is that :) As it was quite a large bread, it lasted a couple of days. I had to pack it with plastic though. I'm gonna try again and try to find a recipe that will be my default, my **daily bread** recipe.

## 1. Wake-up starter (day -1 @ 18h50)
Got the starter out of the fridge. After removing half of the content, I re-fed with 200 gr water and 200 gr all-purpose flour.

## 2. Preferment (day 0 @ 06h50)

Mixed all the ingredients together:
* 139 grams of white flour
* 11 grams of rye flour
* 140 grams of water
* 30 grams of starter

Initially, according to my [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qrST8cpuB7vhlRo7P-tZCccd22Kj1kO7ZyOCIYcYm6U/edit?usp=sharing), it should have been 120 grams of water. However, the preferment was rather dry and difficult to mix together. So I added another 20 grams of water. I mustn't forget to subtract that amount in a later step :)

	</div>

I think the photos above prove that the starter is **alive-and-kicking**.

## 3. Autolyse (day 0 @ 19h20)
Time to whack in the remainder for the dough. According to my calculations, this should be:
* 790 grams of white flour
* 60 grams of rye flour
* 510 grams of water

While mixing it, it looked a bit dry to me. Maybe that's the price for sneaking in those additional 20 grams in the preferment

## 4. Complete dough (day 0 @ 19h57)
After the Autolyse it is time to bring everything together. So I added:
* the preferment
* 22 grams of salt (that is what fitted on one table spoon)

This got mixed together and I kneaded for around 5'. After the kneading, I've let is sleep for 45'

## 5. Intermittent folding 1 (day 0 @ 20h50)

Folding and resting again. The dough was really different from an hour ago. It's coming together :)


## 6. Intermittent folding 2 (day 0 @ 21h50)

The plan was to let it rest for 45' again, but I was playing a game with my brother on [BGA](https://boardgamearena.com/): **Elfenland**. It turned out harder than it seemed from the explanation.

The dough was again different. Like mentioned before, in comparison with my previous attempt, it was much drier. The French folding was a bit more challenging because the dough didn't drop much after picking it up.


## 7. Prepare second proofing (day 0 @ 22h50)

I had a call with my coach, earlier today. In between talking about stuff for work, we also discussed bread. Turns out that the quantities I'm using are actually for two loaves. So, whom am I to question the master ?

Two loaves it is. Packed, tugged in and put in the fridge.

## 8. Baking the first (day 1 @ 09h00)

As I have two loaves, I have to bake two loaves. I want to give them the complete oven each, so I'll be baking in two phases. If I bake those back-to-back (in time) I don't have to preheat a second time :-)

I want the second one to come out of the fridge 24h after it went in. So the oven has to be done.

Working backwards, from 10h50:
* 15' on 230°C
* 25' on 250°C
* 15' preheating

That means ... start at 09h05.

To have some steam in the oven, I just poured in some warm water on the bottom. There was an immediate plume :-) 

## 9. Fresh loaves (day 1 @ 10h20)

Nevertheless, the crust wasn't superb. Good, no doubt about that, but just not superb.

Anyhow, our family ate the whole (right) bread during lunch. So ... it must have been decent :-)
