All right, the first attempt was a failure. That's no big deal, is it ? After giving it some thought, I concluded the following:

* don't feed the starter right before using it
* 12h in the fridge is no good option for fermenting

So ... it's one week later ... let's try again.

## 07h00: Revive the starter

I got the starter from the fridge and fed it. Throwing half of the starter away, replace that same weight with 50/50 water and all-purpose flour. Let it stand in the storage (in our house, which has practically no interior doors, that is the same as the kitchen counter).


## 19h15: Preferment

Finally, it is still *Corona-lockdown* and today I got my hands on some flour: 2.5 kg of white flour and 2.5 kg of rye<sup>1</sup> flour. Together with the flour I also bought a proofing basket.

<sup>1</sup> rye is **rogge** in Dutch

It's time to start the preferment. According to my coach's [page](https://redzuurdesem.be/baking-your-daily-bread/) it makes up 15% of the total (flour) weight. So I mixed:

* 145 gr of white flour
* 10 gr of rye flour
* 145 ml of water
* 30 gr of my sourdough starter

Let's do some math because ... well ... it's fun :-)

* (10*145) gr = 155 gr flour and there is 145 gr of water. 
* This makes this a **93.5 hydration**<sup>2</sup>. 
* 10+145 = 15% of the total weight. So tomorrow I'll need to add 155 gr/15*85 = 878 grams.
* If I want the same proportion of white (x) and rye (y) flour, I'll need:
  * x + y = 878
  * x/y = 145/10
    * 10 x = 145 y and y = 878 - x
    * so 10 x = 145 * (878 - x)
    * (10+145) x = 145 * 878
    * x = 145 * 878 / (10 + 145) = **821 gr**
    * that makes y = 878 - 821 = **57 gr**

<sup>2</sup> is it hydration or hydratation ? Hmm 

Well wasn't that fun :-) Oh ... I need to start mixing my preferment together.

That's it for today. Will be continued tomorrow.

## 7h15: Continue

Goodmorning. Let's check the preferment.
{{< figure position="center" src="/images/baking/preferment2.jpg" title="The overnight preferment" >}}

With the math done, it's only a matter of execution. So I mixed the white and rye flour together with **20 gr of salt** and the preferment. Keeping the same level of hydration, I've added **821 gr of water**. And ... mix !

Hmm, I expected a wet dough, but this is **very wet**.

{{< youtube YShLZwDNY8U >}}

Better check the guide again. **Ohoh**, [it](https://redzuurdesem.be/baking-your-daily-bread/) uses a 70% ratio of water over all the flower that is added. Well let's see what we can make from this *mess*.

Another booboo ... I skipped **autolyse**. I should have added everything except the preferment and salt. This should have rested for half an hour. It's gonna be another fail.

## 08h15: Crisis management

**"'DON'T PANIC' in large, friendly letters on the cover"**, it's the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. **Think !!** I have too much water so I'll throw in some more flour. If my calculations are correct, I'm short 295 grams of flour. Keeping the same ratio this comes down to 19 gr of rye and 276 gr of white. Ok, mix those in. Then let it rest for 45' minutes and try folding again.

With these modification the preferment is no longer 15% of the overall weight in flour. It dropped to 11.7%. According to the guide, it should be between 10 and 35. Maybe, I'll be ok.

Crisis averted (for now).

## 09h00: Better

That looked much better. The consistency is more like I see in clips at youtube. **Phew !** Nonetheless, it's very sticky. My hands were covered in half a centimetre of dough.

## 09h45: Much better

Improvement again :-) The dough starts to feel silky. I folded for around 5 minutes and then did the dough windowpane test, but it tore. After a small 10 more minutes it stayed :-) **Hoozah !** To be sure, I continue folding for a couple of more minutes and then put it to rest for half an hour.

I'm starting to see why all the clips show bakers with metal counters. Ours has a small relief in it and the dough likes grabbing the counter there. Sneaky bastard !!

## 10h30: Putting it to bed
With a the proofing basket prefloured, and a couple of French folds, I managed to get the dough ready for the night. Great !! With this timing, I have fresh break by tomorrow around noon. **Splendid !!**

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 20pt; margin: 50px 0px; font-style: italic;">
  ... 24h later ...
</div>

## 10h08: Preheating the oven
... to 250°C

I took my sourdough from the fridge. The poke-test was ok, but then came the removal of the proofing basket. The bugger hung there like a booger :'(

Let's stay positive, I don't have to score it.

## 10h22: In it goes

{{< figure position="center" src="/images/baking/preoven.jpg" title="The bugger" >}}

## 10h42: Reduce temperature to 230°C

{{< figure position="center" src="/images/baking/halfway.jpg" title="Halfway" >}}

## 10h57: What goes in, must come out

{{< figure position="center" src="/images/baking/done.jpg" title="Done" >}}

I'm happy. Despite all the mistakes I made, this at least looks good :-) I hope the next section will be equally positive.

## Tasting

## Lessons learned

Well there are a lot of lessons to be learned from this first exercise. I'll summarise them here, so with the next experiment I don't have to search for it.

  * preferment was ok
  * precalculate the exact ingredients for less hydration (< 70%)
  * don't forget **autolyse**
  * put a towel in the proofing basket

The recipe for next time:
