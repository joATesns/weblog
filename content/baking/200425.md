All right, the first attempt was a failure. That's no big deal, is it ? After giving it some thought, I concluded the following:

* don't feed the starter right before using it
* 12h in the fridge is no good option for fermenting

So ... it's one week later ... let's try again.

## 07h00: Revive the starter

I got the starter from the fridge and fed it. Throwing half of the starter away, replace that same weight with 50/50 water and all-purpose flour. Let it stand in the storage (in our house, which has practically no interior doors, that is the same as the kitchen counter).


## 19h15: Preferment

Finally, it is still *Corona-lockdown* and today I got my hands on some flour: 2.5 kg of white flour and 2.5 kg of rye<sup>1</sup> flour. Together with the flour I also bought a proofing basket.

<sup>1</sup> rye is **rogge** in Dutch

It's time to start the preferment. According to my coach's [page](https://redzuurdesem.be/baking-your-daily-bread/) it makes up 15% of the total (flour) weight. So I mixed:

* 145 gr of white flour
* 10 gr of rye flour
* 145 ml of water
* 30 gr of my sourdough starter

Let's do some math because ... well ... it's fun :-)

* (10*145) gr = 155 gr flour and there is 145 gr of water. 
* This makes this a **93.5 hydration**<sup>2</sup>. 
* 10+145 = 15% of the total weight. So tomorrow I'll need to add 155 gr/15*85 = 878 grams.
* If I want the same proportion of white (x) and rye (y) flour, I'll need:
  * x + y = 878
  * x/y = 145/10
    * 10 x = 145 y and y = 878 - x
    * so 10 x = 145 * (878 - x)
    * (10+145) x = 145 * 878
    * x = 145 * 878 / (10 + 145) = **821 gr**
    * that makes y = 878 - 821 = **57 gr**

<sup>2</sup> is it hydration or hydratation ? Hmm 

Well wasn't that fun :-) Oh ... I need to start mixing my preferment together.

That's it for today. Will be continued tomorrow.
