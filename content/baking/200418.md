# First bake ... first mistake
I planned on baking my first sourdough today, Saturday April 18th 2020. As you can see on the ["Letâ€™s start with a starter" page](../200404) the starter is ready. So yesterday I went to Aveve to pick up some flour. Guess who I ran into, during lock-down ... my sister-law ... Hi !!

When I was preparing the mise-en-place, I noticed that I didn't bough flour, but a ready-to-go-ish mix. So, rather then wasting my first sourdough experience to a half-ass job, I decided to bake it in a normal fashion. There is enough aggression to work the dough :)

At least I got 2 nice loaves of bread out of it. I must admit ... they were tasty ... fresh and warm out of the oven :)
