# How I've got into this ... Baking
It's all the fault of my (younger) brother (and his girlfriend). For my 37th birthday they gave me a [starter kit](https://www.brouwbroeders.nl/products/starterspakket-belgisch-blond) for home brewing as a present.

Being born and raised in Belgium, I know one thing about beer (other than it's **HEAVEN**): brewing beer doesn't create the best of odors. So ... it took me while before I was home alone and had a perfect opportunity to start brewing.

What happened after that, I summarised here.

Enjoy ... and don't forget to share a drink.


Oh, and as they typically state in .be: _Beer, brewed with love, you drink responsibly !!_
