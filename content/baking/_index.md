Although I always enjoyed eating bread, I never bothered too much about baking my own. There has been a time, before I had kids, I owned a bread-baking machine. However, this was more from a point of convenience. The only dough-experience I had, was making pizza dough. But that happens very rarely.

A colleague at work, [Wouter](https://github.com/wgroeneveld), is a sourdough fanatic. Probably he's objecting to my choice of words, but ... c'mon ... if you write a [book](https://www.bol.com/nl/p/red-zuurdesem/9300000000815597/?referrer=socialshare_pdp_www) about it, it can't be denied.

With me telling stories about brewing, he started telling stories about baking. As we both rely on yeast, it made for nice discussions. So ... I'll try it.

Bon App√©tit !!
