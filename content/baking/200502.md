# Let's try out this Irish recipe

I've been browsing the Internet in search for how to get started with sourdough. One Youtube channel I found is "ilovecookingireland". Patrick Ryan gives a *masterclass* on how to simply bake 2 loaves with sourdough.

This recipe is different from what I have tried before: there is not **preferment**. Ah no guts, no glory ... We'll give it a try.

## Mise en place

* 400 grams of white flour
* 230 grams of water
* 5 grams of salt
* 160 grams of starter

## Recipe

### Mixing and first proofing
Everthing, except for the start, went into the bows. I mixed it together. Then, I added the starter and started kneading.

This took around 10 minutes or so. With the Window-pane technique I verified that the kneading was sufficient. 

With the kneading done, I've put it away for proofing for 3h
