## Observation(s)

At the moment is Sunday, so yesterday we had a party for my brothers birthday and also a sort of goodbye party for my sister-in-law who leaves in a couple of hours for a 3-week trip to Thailand. What does any of that have to do with looking at the stars ? Well ... beer. With the tiniest bit of having drunk too much, stargazing becomes a little more ... challenging and physical let's say :-) #WhoWouldHaveThought 

Anyway, I was able to spend an hour of looking up before I was getting too cold (it's 2Â°C atm). Most of the time I spend looking at **Ori**.

When I was young(er) I only knew the belt. The three stars in a row. By now I understand (a bit) more. Depending on the conditions Orion show more or less of itself. I've been looking to Betelgeuse (&alpha; Ori) and Rigel (&beta; Ori) before (not with a telescope, mind you). Something that intrigued me was the **cloud** between the hunter's legs (man, that sounds disgusting). Because the night's sky was so clear (except from the moonlight) I could have closer look. Even with my telescope it was quite hard to get a clear image on what is there. One thing I clearly found (even with binoculars) was right-angled triangle (Google ... is that a correct translation ? Pfff, it's 4AM, no time for GrammarNazi). After some googling I found that I was looking at M42 and M43

It's shame I don't see the thing above in my ocular, but hey ... it's ok ... I'm only just starting. Right ?


## TODO:
* figure out the up-side-down-iness when looking at the moon *DUHU*

Let' just keep the TODO's until I have a definite answer.
