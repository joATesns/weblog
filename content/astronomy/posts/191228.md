## Spotted through Telescope:

* nothing

## Observation(s)

In Dutch there is an expression: "terugkeren van een kale kermis", which is a more poetic way of expressing that things didn't go as planned. Translating this literally would be: returning from a bald fun fair.

When I got up is was clouded, but with quite a number of cloud-free patches. When I was al set up, these patches were gone :( Alas ... After waiting from 20 more minutes, with no changes in the sky, I decided to break camp. Hence I'm sitting here at my laptop writing a blog post instead.

## TODO:

* study up on Physics wrt lenses an the **refraction** of light

* figure out the up-side-down-iness when looking at the moon *DUHU*

Everything is corrected. Top is top and left is left. So this makes me think that there is a correction in the eyepiece. **more details needed**
