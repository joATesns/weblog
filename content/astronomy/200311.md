## Spotted through Telescope:

* Nothing due to weather 

## Observation(s)

Today I was finally able to make it to another Tycho gathering. The previous 2 I had to skip due to: illness and being abroad for work. Because the weather was very bad, as was predicted, they provided an alternative program. A member of [Urania](https://www.urania.be/) (Jef De Wit) gave a presentation on **Astro Sketching**. With no expectations I went in ...

During the presentation I noted down quite some things:

* [Deepskylog](https://www.deepskylog.be/) A database that gather sketches from around the world.
* Dark places: 
  * Oesterput (+)
  * Postel (-)
  * Medendorf (+)
* did you know that people can see polarised light ? Apparently there is thing called [Haidinger's brush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haidinger%27s_brush)

After the presentation we had to sketch ourselves. Behold my result before and after Gimp.

I have to confess that the central nebula was present in the image, but (as you can see) not on my sketch. As I'd seen it, I took the artistic liberty of adding in using software.

Additions to might: need-to-investigate list

* Try to see Mercurius, it never disappoints (they say)
* The mussle man
* Sirius-B
* Asterismen
* The Lunar 100


## TODO:

* study up on Physics wrt lenses an the **refraction** of light

* figure out the up-side-down-iness when looking at the moon *DUHU*

Everything is corrected. Top is top and left is left. So this makes me think that there is a correction in the eyepiece. **more details needed**
