## Observation(s)

Field trip
When I looked outside, tonight, it was a very clear sky. Also the moon was not coming out for long, so I hit the road again. With my telescope in the car, I've set off.

My first guess at finding a good spot was a view point in Zonhoven. I know the place from hearing people talk about it, but I never visited it. When I drove up to the parking, it was all muddy and full of puddles. As I had **no** idea of where to go, I decided to postpone this location for star gazing. I should be great out there, as can be seen from the feratel stream below:

The next spot ...

## Ponderings

## TODO:

* study up on Physics wrt lenses an the **refraction** of light

* figure out the up-side-down-iness when looking at the moon *DUHU*

Everything is corrected. Top is top and left is left. So this makes me think that there is a correction in the eyepiece. **more details needed**
