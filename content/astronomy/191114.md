## Spotted through Telescope:

* the moon

## Observation(s)

Yesterday there was a full moon, so today is Waning Gibbous. I just found a site for checking this [here](https://www.moongiant.com/phase/today/). Apparently the moon is at a distance of 390'663.83 km from earth. It **is** true that the terminator is the most spectacular thing to see. With the moon almost complete illuminated, you see no relief what-so-ever :(

Two things sprung to mind: one (large) sea and two ray systems. 
The crater I've seen was in the fourth quadrant and probably is the **Mare Nectaris**. There was one little crater to the left ... while writing this (and thinking about up-side-down imagery) it might be that I've seen **Mare Crisium** this is something to figure out.
The two ray systems were on the second quadrant and I suspect them to be the **Copernicus** and **Kepler** ray systems.

## TODO:
* figure out the up-side-down-iness when looking at the moon *DUHU*
