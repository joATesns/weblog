## How I've got into this ... Astronomy
Well, I can't remember a time I was **not** into astronomy (and space-stuff). Although I never actively spend a huge amount of hours stargazing, I did look up occasionaly. For my 38th birthday, my spouse, kids and in laws bought me my first [telescope](https://www.meade.com/infinity-102mm-altazimuth-refractor.html).

What happened after that, I summarised here.

Enjoy ... and don't forget to look up into the night's sky for yourself.


## So ... whereto next ?
Below is a list of posts I wrote on what I was able to observer in the night sky. Living in a city in Belgium, means the conditions are not perfect on a daily basis ;-)
