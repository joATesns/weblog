# How I've got into this ... Astronomy
Well, I can't remember a time I was **not** into astronomy (and space-stuff: #hooray for [Kerbal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/)). Although I never actively spend a huge amount of hours stargazing, I did look up occasionaly. For my 38th birthday, my spouse, kids and in laws bought me my first [telescope](https://www.meade.com/infinity-102mm-altazimuth-refractor.html).

What happened after that, I summarised here.

Enjoy ... and don't forget to look up into the night's sky for yourself.
