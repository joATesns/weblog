Today I went to a Tycho meeting. Tycho is one of the three associations with the Cosmodrome in Genk. This work group focuses on **observartion**. The second Wednesday of every month they gater and observe the night's sky (using the big telescope or personal gear) and/or discuss one topic.

After an intersting presentation and discussion we went up the big telscope and had a look. Although it was quite cloudy, it was full moon and we could have go with different oculars.

Other than an a nice meeing and peek through the scope, I learned something new: **a moon halo**. This halo is 22Â° around the Moon (or Sun) and occurs when moonlight is refracted in millons of hexagonal ice crystals which are susend in the atmosphere.

According to wikipedia, seeing a Moon halo is something that happes much more frequently than seeing a rainbow ... nice !!
