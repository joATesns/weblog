## Spotted through Telescope:

* the Pleiades

## Observation(s)

* I have read a number of stories on the cultural tales of constellations. [One of them](https://experienceastronomy.com/pleiades-seven-sisters/) tells of how Orion was punished for chasing 7 sisters and how it got punished by chasing them for eternity. Ever since reading that story, I was looking for the Pleiades. Tonight, I found them.

After some browsing I found out there also is an open star Cluser (M45). That will be for another night.

The Hubble space telescope can make nicer pictures than I can :)

* On another note, tomorrow is the winter solstice (at 04:19). So this makes tonight one of the longest nights of the year, **YEY**

## TODO:

* study up on Physics wrt lenses an breaking of light

**LANGUAGE !!** It's not the breaking of light, it's the *refraction* of light, foolish boy ! After a short discussion with the Physics professor, I'm working on this.

* figure out the up-side-down-iness when looking at the moon *DUHU*

Everything is corrected. Top is top and left is left. So this makes me think that there is a correction in the eyepiece. **more details needed**
