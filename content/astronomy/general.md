# It's all in th numbers

Here I want so summarise some numbers. Apparently some of those **should** be by heart, but ... I prefer a small cheat sheet:

| variable | value |
|-|-|
|the speed of light | 3e+5 km/s |
|Astronomical Unit (AU)<br/>= d(earth, sun)| 1.496e+8 km |

Let's quickly calculate:
1.496e+8 km at 3e+5 km/s => approx. 0.5e+3 s for sun light to reach earth.
500 sec comes down to 8 minutes and 20 seconds
