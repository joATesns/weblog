## It's all in the vocabulary

| variable | value |
|---|---|
| [Kármán Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line) | The edge between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space, set at 100 km |


## It's all in the numbers

Here I want so summarise some numbers. Apparently some of those **should** be known by heart, but ... I prefer a small cheat sheet:

| variable | value |
|---|---|
|the speed of light | 3e+5 km/s |
|Astronomical Unit (AU)<br/>= d(earth, sun)| 1.496e+8 km |

Let's quickly calculate:

* 1.496e+8 km at 3e+5 km/s => approx. 0.5e+3 s for sun light to reach earth. 500 sec comes down to 8 minutes and 20 seconds
